# Logo Transparency Information

To make the logo background transparent:

1. Open the SkyView_Logo.jpeg file in an image editor that supports transparency (like Photoshop, GIMP, or an online tool like remove.bg)

2. Remove the background to make it transparent

3. Save as a PNG file with transparency enabled

4. Replace the current logo file with this transparent PNG version

Note: JPEGs do not support transparency, so the file needs to be converted to PNG format.
