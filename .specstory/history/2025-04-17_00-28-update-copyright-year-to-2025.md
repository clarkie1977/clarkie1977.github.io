Okay, I can help with that. I'll start by finding all the HTML files in your workspace.

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory • **20** results</summary>
        
| Name |

| 📁 `.git` |
| 📄 `contact.html` |
| 📄 `privacy.html` |
| 📄 `terms.html` |
| 📄 `services.html` |
| 📄 `portfolio.html` |
| 📄 `about.html` |

Okay, I've found the following HTML files:
- `contact.html`
- `privacy.html`
- `terms.html`
- `services.html`
- `portfolio.html`
- `about.html`
- `index.html`

Now I will update the copyright year in each of these files. I'll start with `contact.html`.

It seems the last edit for `index.html` didn't go through correctly. I'll check the footer section of that file and try the edit again.



---

Read file: index.html

It looks like the year was already updated in `index.html`. My apologies for the confusion.

All the HTML files should now have the copyright year updated to 2025 in the footer.
